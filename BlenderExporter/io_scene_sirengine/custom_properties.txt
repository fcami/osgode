oo_polygon_offset <height>, Object property
    displace a surface above the others.
    When two surfaces conicide, that one with the higher offset is shown.
    glPolygonOffset( factor = value * -0.1, units = value * -1.0 ) is applied




oo_max_distance <distance>, Light property, pViewer only
    deactivate the light when it is too far away.
    The parameter is the distance between the eye point and the center of the
    light. This property does not have sense for non-positionable lights




oo_border_to_alpha <unused>, Texture property
    use GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER and border color = [1,1,1,0]




oo_max_anisotropy <max_anisotropy>, Texture property
    set the max anisotropy




oo_fast_point <fast positional light>, Light property
    a fake point light ( normals are not used during computations )




pfps_pickable, Game property
